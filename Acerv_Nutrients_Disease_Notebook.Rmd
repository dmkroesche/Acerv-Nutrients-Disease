This file analyzes the changes in S/H cell ratio in *A. cervicornis* spp.:

* 11 genotypes were sampled before and after nutrient exposure. These fragments were then exposed to a coral disease during which survivorship was tracked.

* These coral fragments came from coral nurseries belonging to UM, CRF, and FWC.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

library(steponeR)

Acer.plates <- list.files(path="Data", pattern=".csv", full.names=T)

Acer.plates


Acer.Out <- steponeR(files=Acer.plates, target.ratios=c("A.Acerv", "D.Acerv"), 
                     fluor.norm=list(A=1, D=1, Acerv=1),
                     copy.number=list(A=9, D=1, Acerv=1),
                     ploidy=list(A=1, D=1, Acerv=2),
                     extract=list(A=0.813, D=0.813, Acerv=0.982))
# Target ratio results
Acer<-Acer.Out$result

write.csv(Acer, "Acer_ratios.csv")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
